#Powder Simulator

A simple powder toy-like program for my software engineering class

## How to run

- Make sure CMake is installed
- run `cmake .` in the root of the project, then `make` in the same directory
- run `./powdersim` for linux and mac, or `./powdersim.exe` for windows

## Notes from Jake
    - Push Access Works
    - Project is Runnable
    - I needed to install SFML as well, 'brew install SFML' fixed my error.
    - Upon OS update (Mac machine), errors occurred. Delete 'CMakeCache.txt' and rerun as above.
